# Essential vs. Accidental Complexity in Scala & Dotty: Towards a Puzzler-free Future?

(How) can we construct a programming language that is elegant without being elementary; expressive without becoming exasperating? Scala offers a wide range of features and ideas that can be as puzzling as they are powerful.

We will take a look at these ideas and features and, through the lens of a "cluster analysis" of puzzlers, will try to identify parts of the language that are especially prone to head-scratching behaviour. We will examine which of the clusters are intrinsic and perhaps inevitable given Scala's design goals, and which are accidental and could possibly be avoided in future.

We'll look forward to Dotty and the types of puzzling behaviour it will eliminate, and close with the story of a particularly pernicious "sleeping puzzler giant" that the Dotty team has slain.
