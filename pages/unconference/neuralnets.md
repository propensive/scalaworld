### 30 minutes (up to 45 min with additional live demo)

Deep Neural Network gets widely used in pattern recognition, like classification or prediction, based on unstructured data, such as images, text, audio, sensory data, weblogs. It breaks records continuaslly in both of speed and accuracy.

This talk turns a spotlight on the behaviour of Neural Networks. Neural Networks map N-Dimensional sample data input to another value, vector or N-Dimensional output. So Neural Network is a function.

This Neural Network function is composed of various function units as well, such as neurons, activation functions or loss functions. So you'll see the essense of how and what to work underneath Neural Networks in this session.

Simple Deep Neural Network Live demo in Scala will be prepared, but optional depending on the timetable.
