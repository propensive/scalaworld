### 60 minutes

Reports on recent progress into sbt 1.0, which splits up some of the modules into separate repository, including incremental compiler by non-Josh members of the sbt team (This is the first time we meet face to face, so it could be awkward).

The second half can be used as a general Q&A and workshop about sbt and builds.
