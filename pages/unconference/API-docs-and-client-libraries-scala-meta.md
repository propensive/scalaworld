## Extracting API documentation and client libraries with scala.meta

### [Andrea Lattuada](https://github.com/utaal), 20 minutes

Scala is an egregious langage to construct a well-typed representation of the structure of a client-agnostic HTTP-based API. Case classes and a subset of the spray-routing dsl can become the source of truth for the API declarations: we talk about our experience with using scala.meta to extract this information and build both detailed human-readable documentation and well-typed client code for other languages. We explore our findings, some pitfalls and compare the approach to other API declaration tools such as Swagger.
