Here are some links that could help you during my talk:

 - [Dotty sample phase](https://github.com/DarkDimius/dotty/tree/optional)
   Dotty is build by sbt. And the script `bin/dotc` should allow you to compile files with Dotty.

   The first time you run it, it will actually compile dotty with scalac, so it would take time.
